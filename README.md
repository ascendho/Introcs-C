## Overview

<img src="img/cover.png" align="right" width=110 hspace=1>This repository hosts the C version source code for the  textbook <a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/computer-science-an-interdisciplinary-approach/P200000007399?view=educator">Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach</a>, co-authored by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, and is named a Notable Book in the 21st Annual Best of Computing list by the ACM.

The book is intended for a first course in computer science for the next generation of scientists and engineers, pioneering Princeton computer science professors Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne introduces core Java programming techniques in a scientific context, while also demystifying computation and illuminating its intellectual underpinnings.

You can find and download the original Java code and much more other extensive supplementary information, including suggested approaches to programming assignments, checklists, and FAQs, at this companion web <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">site</a>.



## Goal

Because the first programming language many computer science students are exposed to is C, it makes sense to translate the java code in the textbook to C. Thus my goal is to make every student or programmer who is currently only familiar with C can follow this book easily.

Strive to keep variable names, function names, program comments, etc. consistent with the original java version, while also writing idiomatic C code.
