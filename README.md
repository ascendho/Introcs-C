## Overview

<img src="img/cover.png" align="right" width=110 hspace=1>This repository contains the C version source code for the  textbook <a href="https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/computer-science-an-interdisciplinary-approach/P200000007399?view=educator">Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach</a> written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The book is intended for a first course in computer science for the next generation of scientists and engineers, pioneering Princeton computer science professors Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne introduces core Java programming techniques in a scientific context, while also demystifying computation and illuminating its intellectual underpinnings.

You can find and download the original Java code and many other extensive supplementary information, including suggested approaches to programming assignments, checklists, and FAQs, at this companion web <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">site</a>.
